You can work with Kit and REPL in multiple different ways.

** REPL during development
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: repl-during-development
:END:
During development, you can:

- Start a local REPL in terminal using =clj -M:dev=.
- Start a local instance of nREPL using =clj -M:dev:nrepl= and interact
  with it either from terminal or from your preferred editor. If you
  want to use nREPL with CIDER, run =clj -M:dev:cider= instead.

Alternatively, you can start your project as a standalone application
and connect to it from an external editor as described below.

** Connecting to the REPL in production
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: connecting-to-the-repl-in-production
:END:
If you want a REPL to run when your system is running, for example in
production or standalone mode, you can use one of two libraries
available for Kit: [[/docs/kit-repl.html][kit-repl]] or
[[/docs/kit-nrepl.html][kit-nrepl]]. You can include either of them in
your project using an appropriate [[/docs/profiles.html][profile]]:
=+socket-repl= or =+full= for kit-repl, and =+nrepl= for kit-nrepl.

With these libraries in place, running the server using the =(go)=
command will also run the REPL, allowing you to connect to it from your
preferred editor. Note that by default, the REPL only listens for
/local/ connections on port 7200 (for socket REPL), and 7000 (for
nREPL). You can change this in =system.edn= or by setting the
=REPL_PORT= or =NREPL_PORT= environment variable.
