The =kit-quartz= library adds [[https://github.com/juxt/aero][aero]]
reader support around the
[[https://github.com/troy-west/cronut][cronut]] library for the
[[][quartz]] scheduler.

This is a means of setting environment properties during runtime. It is
useful in case there's a scenario where you can't (for whatever reason)
set secrets in your JVM properties.

For example, let's say you are using MongoDB as your Quartz scheduler
cluster and fetching the configuration on production from environment
variables. For whatever reason, you cannot simply pipe in these
environment variables on startup (maybe some devops restriction, who
knows), then you can set it as follows.

#+begin_src clojure
:quartz/env-properties
      #profile {:default {}
                :prod    {:org.quartz.jobStore.collectionPrefix "my_mongo_coll_prefix"
                          :org.quartz.jobStore.addresses        #env MONGODB_CLUSTERS
                          :org.quartz.jobStore.username         #env MONGODB_USERNAME
                          :org.quartz.jobStore.password         #env MONGODB_PASSWORD}}
#+end_src
