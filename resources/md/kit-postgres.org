The =kit-postgres= library simply extends
[[https://github.com/seancorfield/next-jdbc][next-jdbc]]'s
=next.jdbc.result-set/ReadableColumn= and
=next.jdbc.prepare/SettableParameter= to serialize =Instant=s,
=LocalDate=s, =LocalDateTime=s, and =IPersistentMap=s, and deserialize
=Array=s and =PGobject=s. It requires
[[https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire][cheshire]] as a dependency for
JSON serialization/deserialization. You can further extend these
protocols as you desire.
