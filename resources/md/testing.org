Kit sets up a default test harness found in the =test= directory of the
project. It comes supplied with a =test-utils= namespace that has some
handy utilities for testing

#+begin_example
(ns <app-ns>.test-utils
  (:require
    [<app-ns>.core :as core]))

(defn system-state []
  (or @core/system state/system))

(defn system-fixture
  []
  (fn [f]
    (when (nil? (system-state))
      (core/start-app {:opts {:profile :test}}))
    (f)))
#+end_example

The =system-fixture= can be used as a fixture before any tests that
require your system to be started. It ensures that the system boots with
the test environment.

You can use =system-state= to get the current running state of your
system. This is handy if you need to reference, access, or override
components for individual tests.
