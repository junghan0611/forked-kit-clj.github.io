The assets for the application are located under the =resources= folder.
Assets include any non-source files that you may wish to include in the
application. These may be database migration files, SQL query files, and
so on.

By default, the =resources/public= folder is reserved for assets that
will be served directly by the HTTP server. This is where you would
place assets such as images and CSS. This path can be customized should
you wish to place publicly available assets under a different directory.
This is configured in your =system.edn= under the =:handler/ring=
component's =:site-defaults-config= key.
