*** :db.sql/migrations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: db.sqlmigrations
:END:
This component uses [[https://github.com/yogthos/migratus][migratus]] to
execute your migrations. It optionally takes a =migrate-on-init?= key
that defaults to =true=. When =true=, this key ensures your migrations
run when the component is initialized.

The component resolves to the configuration options that are initially
passed in.

Sample configuration:

```clojure :db.sql/migrations {:store :database :migration-dir
"custom-migrations" :init-script "init.sql" ;script should be located in
the :migration-dir path ;defaults to true, some databases do not support
;schema initialization in a transaction :init-in-transaction? false
:migration-table-name "foo_bar" :db {:datasource #ig/ref
:db.sql/connection} :migrate-on-init? true}
